## Morning

Wake up late, i don't do much on the morning.

## Afternoon

Working with BunJS again.

ReactJS with BunJS feel good together.

Trying to dockerize my React+Bun project. At first, I faced many problem, but it worked.

My project is simple, a simple API and React front-end. React will fetch data from API and display it.

I will write about this project later, maybe Sunday.

## Night

Still working on React but for a client. They want to use DevExpress and MUI (Material-UI).

And... it is kinda complex :(

Anyway, i got it to work, just a simple example on DevExpress website.

That looks good. I am thinking to use it with Vue, and yes, they support Vue.
