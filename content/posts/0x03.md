## Morning

Wake up late (again), do nothing until 3pm

## Afternoon

I am making a webhook python, which is very simple by sending a POST request to Discord api.

Create and successfully deploy it to Azure by create and publish it as a Docker image.

At first, I wanted to create a web server which allow people to register their webhook, but it turned out quite complicated and I want to create something simple. So that, I removed all the server code, all left is a static webhooks and a POST method.

## Night

Thinking of writing a blog post on Docker and BunJS. Nah, too lazy, I will do it tomorrow.

Now learning about DevExpress and MUI :D.
