## Morning

Wake up at 6AM, then hang out and coffee with friends.

Head back at 8AM, and have breakfast.

Check out some git repo, having some ideas to work with Astro and CodeChoVui blog.

Go out, buy, and cook something for lunch.

This afternoon should be about the Thesis. I will need to config TheHive and Cortex, and integrate them with MISP. Currently, TheHive is having some issues connecting with Cortex.

The document is unclear for running TheHive in Docker. I hate it when the document is wrong and no responsibility to update it.

Some remaining tasks are:

- [ ] Investigate why TheHive is unable to connect to Cortex even the configs are OK.
- [ ] Update Shuffle workflow that for every observable added to TheHive, it will auto run the Cortex Analyzer and collect the report.
- [ ] Update Shuffle workflow that will assign each person with each task created automatically when adding observables.
- [ ] Learn how to work with Ansible in Shuffle
- [ ] Itegrate MISP with current SOAR
